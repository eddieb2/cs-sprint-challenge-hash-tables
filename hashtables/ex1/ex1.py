'''
Given a package with a weight limit `limit` and a list `weights` of item
weights, implement a function `get_indices_of_item_weights` that finds
two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit `limit`. Your
function will return a tuple of integers that has the following form:

```
(zero, one)
```

where each element represents the item weights of the two packages.
_**The higher valued index should be placed in the `zeroth` index and
the smaller index should be placed in the `first` index.**_ If such a
pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return
`None`.


## Hints

* A brute-force solution would involve two nested loops, yielding a
  quadratic-runtime solution. How can we use a hash table in order to
  implement a solution with a better runtime?

* Think about what we can store in the hash table in order to help us to
  solve this problem more efficiently. 

* What if we store each weight in the input list as keys? What would be
  a useful thing to store as the value for each key? 

* If we store each weight's list index as its value, we can then check
  to see if the hash table contains an entry for `limit - weight`. If it
  does, then we've found the two items whose weights sum up to the
  `limit`!
